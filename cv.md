# Summary

I've been working at Central Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics as an engeneer and lead engeneer since November 2008.

I really enjoy coding and want to work and keep growing in the mobile/backend field. I don't have any experience but I spend my free time making some pet-projects.
